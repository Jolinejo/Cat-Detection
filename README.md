# Cat-Detection
A haar cascade model for detecting cat faces

The used training set was failry small (400 pos, 800 negs) so the accuracy is not the best

When running the model setting minNeighbours to 3 is the best for reducing false positives, but it increases false negatives
Seeting minNeighbours to 1 is the best for reducing false
 negatives, but it increases false positives
